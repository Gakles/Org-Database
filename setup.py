BGCSV serves approximately 5,000 regular members at 33 Clubhouses locations in San Jose, Morgan Hill, Gilroy and beyond. The majority of the youth we serve are living in economically depressed, high crime neighborhoods with an absence of positive adult role models or mentors. BGCSV takes a holistic approach to creating well-rounded, confident, and healthy youth and aims to provide programs and services that speak to all aspects of a childâ€™s development. To achieve these goals, comprehensive curricula are provided within the following Core Enrichment Program Areas that address the academic, linguistic and cognitive growth, and emotional and social needs of youth. Core Program Areas are age and developmentally appropriate; are supportive of the diversity of children and families served, including culture and language; and are operationally efficient and effective."
